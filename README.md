# TODO
- Background for site. Plan is to have it looking like squares raining down in random sequence. Constraints are:
    - max of 20 "droplets" on screen at once
    - each "droplet" starts with a single #fff square
    - with each frame the sqaure drops 100% of its own height + some gutter
    - with each frame the sqaure gets 20% dimmer
    - by 5 drops each "droplet" should be complete
    - [optional] with each drop of the square the previous square stays but is reduced in brightness by 20% (this should create a trail)
