#TODO
- slide in aside when user adds first song to playlist
- fix for wrapping song titles
- display all artists, not just the first artist
- potentially take user to a page where the playlist is embedded in the webview to let the, play it?
- optimise for mobile (eek!)
- add more tracks to results and investigate if there is a better way to search for tracks
