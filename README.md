#TODO
- slide in aside when user adds first song to playlist
- allow logout
- fix for wrapping song titles
- add user feedback ("playlist saved!" or something) - This should also reset the app so search and playlist is emptied out
- potentially take user to a page where the playlist is embedded in the webview to let the, play it?
- show user they can edit the playlist title
- optimise for mobile (eek!)
